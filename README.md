# pqfif-oss
pqfif-oss is a collection of open-source projects and AI resources that we have organized, gathered, and created to meet and implement the PQFIF (Post-Quantum Financial Infrastructure Framework, https://www.sec.gov/files/cft-written-input-daniel-bruno-corvelo-costa-090325.pdf). It aims to provide tools, methodologies, and reference practices for professionals working in the PQFIF field. 

We welcome nominations of relevant open-source tools from all PQFIF professionals and enthusiasts.
